What Are the Restrictions and Limitations on SMS Messaging?
===========================================================

You can send at most 60 SMS messages to a single phone number within one hour and 200 within 12 hours.

This limit is applicable only to SMS messaging. There is no limit on the number of messages you can publish to a topic.

If an SMS message contains more than 1,000 characters, the SMS message cannot be sent to the SMS endpoint.

The following table describes the rules for calculating the number of characters in an SMS message.
