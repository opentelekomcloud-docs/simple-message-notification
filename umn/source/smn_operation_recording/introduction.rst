Introduction
============

You can use Cloud Trace Service (CTS) to record information about SMN-related operations, including request content, source IP addresses, request senders, and when a request was sent, for future query, audit, and backtracking.

CTS can record operations performed on the management console, performed by calling APIs, and triggered within the cloud system.
