Introduction
============

A message sent to the HTTP or HTTPS endpoint is automatically assembled by SMN. HTTP/HTTPS messages can be classified as management messages and service messages.

-  Management messages include subscription messages and subscription cancellation messages.
-  Service messages include notification messages. An HTTP/HTTPS message is composed of a message header and body, which are illustrated in detail in this topic.
