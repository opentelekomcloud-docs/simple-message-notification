SMN and Other Services
======================

SMN can be interconnected with other cloud services to provide them with messaging capabilities so that these services can send notifications to tenants or their message processing systems. For details about how to use SMN in other cloud services, see user guides of the related services.

The following are examples of some services using SMN.

-  `Cloud Eye <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/ces/en-us_topic_0015479882.html>`__

   After an alarm rule is configured, Cloud Eye can use SMN to send alarm notifications to specific users.

-  `Anti-DDoS <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/antiddos/en-us_topic_0023977447.html>`__

   Anti-DDoS uses SMN to notify users by email or SMS message once a DDoS attack occurs.

-  `CTS <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/cts/en-us_topic_0030579718.html>`__

   CTS can be integrated with SMN to notify users of key events. SMN also uses CTS to record service resource operations.

-  `OBS <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/obs/en-us_topic_0045853692.html>`__

   OBS uses SMN to send OBS bucket events to applications for processing.
