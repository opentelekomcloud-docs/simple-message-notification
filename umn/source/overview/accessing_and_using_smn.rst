Accessing and Using SMN
=======================

You can access the SMN service using a web-based management console and HTTPS-based APIs.

-  **Management console**

   The management console is a web user interface for you to manage your computing, storage, and other cloud resources. You can log in the management console and select **Simple Message Notification** on the homepage to switch to the SMN console.

-  **APIs**

   If you want to integrate SMN into a third-party system for secondary development, you can access SMN using APIs. For details, see `Simple Message Notification API Reference <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/api/smn/en-us_topic_0036017316.html>`__.
