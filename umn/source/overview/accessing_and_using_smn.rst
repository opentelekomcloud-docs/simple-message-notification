Accessing and Using SMN
=======================

The cloud platform provides a web-based management console and HTTPS-based APIs through which you can access the SMN service.

-  Management console

   The management console is a web user interface for you to manage your computing, storage, and other cloud resources. After you register an account on the management console, you can log in and select **Simple Message Notification** on the homepage to switch to the SMN console.

-  API calling

   If you want to integrate SMN into a third-party system for secondary development, you can access SMN using APIs. For details, see the *Simple Message Notification API Reference*.
